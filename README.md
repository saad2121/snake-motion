# snake-motion
Studied modular robot locomotion and snake gait cycle.
Simulated in the V-rep environment with Matlab API functions.
Modelled snake gaits (Lateral Undulation, Linear Progression, Rolling, Sidewinding, Turning) using Arduino Nano microcontroller to
control servos mounted on the 3D printed snake.
